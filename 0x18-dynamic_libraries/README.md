Dynamic libraries are shared code files that can be loaded and linked at runtime.
$LD_LIBRARY_PATH is an environment variable that specifies directories to search for dynamic libraries.
Static libraries are linked with the executable at compile-time, while dynamic libraries are linked at runtime using tools like nm, ldd, and ldconfig.
