# Make and Makefiles

This brief README provides a quick overview of Make and Makefiles:

## What are Make and Makefiles?
- **Make:** Make is a build automation tool that manages project file dependencies and automates the build process.
- **Makefiles:** Makefiles are configuration files that define how to build and maintain a project.

## When to Use Makefiles
Use Makefiles for projects with multiple files and dependencies. They simplify and automate the build process.

## Key Concepts
- **Rules:** Define how to build targets (e.g., executables) from dependencies.
- **Explicit and Implicit Rules:** Explicit rules are defined in Makefiles, while implicit rules are predefined.
- **Common Rules:** Examples include "all," "clean," "install," and "test."
- **Variables:** Store and reuse values like compiler flags and paths.

## Usage
1. Create a `Makefile` in your project's root directory.
2. Define rules for building targets and specify dependencies.
3. Run `make target_name` to build your project.
