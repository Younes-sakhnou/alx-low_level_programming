## Hash Functions and Hash Tables

This README provides a brief overview of hash functions, hash tables, and their common use cases.

### What is a hash function?

A hash function is a mathematical function that takes an input (or "key") and returns a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hash value or a hash code. Hash functions are designed to efficiently map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values.

### What makes a good hash function?

A good hash function should have the following properties:
- It should generate a unique hash value for each unique input.
- It should produce a consistent hash value for the same input.
- It should distribute the hash values uniformly across the entire range.
- It should minimize collisions (i.e., when two different inputs produce the same hash value).

### What is a hash table?

A hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to corresponding values. It provides efficient key-value pair lookups, insertions, and deletions.

### How do hash tables work and how to use them?

Hash tables consist of an array of "buckets" and a hash function. When a key-value pair is inserted, the hash function is applied to the key to determine the index of the corresponding bucket. The value is then stored in that bucket. When retrieving a value, the hash function is again applied to the key to find the appropriate bucket and retrieve the value.

To use a hash table, you need to provide unique keys for each value you want to store. You can then perform operations like inserting values, retrieving values based on keys, and deleting values from the hash table.

### Collision handling in hash tables

Collisions occur when two different keys produce the same hash value. Common collision handling techniques in the context of hash tables include:
- Chaining: Each bucket contains a linked list of key-value pairs that share the same hash value.
- Open addressing: In case of a collision, the hash table probes other buckets to find an available slot to store the value.

### Advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables

Advantages of using hash tables include:
- Fast access to values based on keys, typically with constant time complexity.
- Efficient for large data sets.
- Ideal for scenarios that require frequent lookups, insertions, and deletions.

Drawbacks of using hash tables include:
- Hash functions and collision handling can introduce additional complexity.
- Memory usage may be higher compared to other data structures.
- Hash table performance may degrade if the load factor becomes too high.

### Common use cases of hash tables

Hash tables are commonly used in various scenarios, such as:
- Implementing caches to store frequently accessed data.
- Indexing and searching data in databases.
- Counting occurrences or tracking frequencies of elements.
- Efficiently storing and retrieving key-value pairs.
