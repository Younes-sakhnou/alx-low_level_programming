Bit manipulation means working with the individual bits of binary data. In other words, we're looking at the zeroes and ones that make up a piece of binary data and doing things with them. Bitwise operators are special tools that let us manipulate these bits in different ways. For example, we can use them to turn on or off specific bits, or to move the bits to the left or right. To get started with this, you'll need to understand how binary numbers work (that they're made up of zeroes and ones) and learn about some basic rules for combining these zeroes and ones (like AND, OR, XOR, and NOT).
